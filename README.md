this is a fork made to work on adding support for `max_connection_idle_time`

- [ ] Add and wire up the new `max_connection_idle_time` option in CLI, config, and driver initialization.  
- [ ] Write unit tests to confirm correct parsing and parameter passing.
- [ ] Run an integration test with Neo4j to verify stability and idle connection handling.  
- [ ] Update documentation and confirm backward compatibility with existing setups.
